          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is Sean Cranston, and I am an aspiring Software Developer. I graduated from George Mason University in 2014, with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Criminology, Law & Society. I have experience working for U.S. Customs & Border Protection, U.S. Navy, and currently INTERPOL. The skills I have developed in my young career include research, data analysis, and briefing/public speaking. I am looking to transition my skilset towards the technical arena, and enhance my software development skills. <br><br> I have additional skills in personal finance and wealth management. These skills provide me the ability to help individual budget their income, eliminate debt, and finally investing their money into investment vehicles for future growth.
